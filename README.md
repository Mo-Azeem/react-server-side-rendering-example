# This is my basic implementation of Server Side Rendering Using ReactDOMServer

### The tech that was used :-

- react
- react-dom/server
- express
- typescript

Again, this is a very basic implmentation, note that typescript compiler does all of the compilation work, see tsconfig.ts settings for more information.
